This is my first blog made for the ETC5523 Communicating with Data assessment at Monash University.

I am Tycia, a student at Monash University, where I completed my Bachelor’s degree in IT majoring in Interactive Media and am now pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics. Originally from Indonesia, I have been living in Melbourne since 2017, and I am fluent in Indonesian, English, and Javanese.

I am passionate about food, especially anything related to seafood—it is definitely my favorite! Living in Melbourne has given me the chance to explore a wide variety of dishes while staying connected to my love for Indonesian flavors.

Balancing my academic journey in business analytics with my passion for interactive media has been exciting. I love immersing myself in Melbourne’s diverse culture and tech scene, which has shaped my experiences both personally and professionally.
