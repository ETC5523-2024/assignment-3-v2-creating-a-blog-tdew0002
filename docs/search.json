    "text": "The Data for the Investigation\n\nWhere to get the data?\nTo investigate this weather fluctuation further in the last two years, I gathered data from the Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology website here, for weather reports in the Melbourne area near Olympic Park, which is relatively a more central area.\nThe two main datasets I collected were:\n\nThe minimum temperature data here.\nThe maximum temperature data here.\n\n\n\nWhat is inside the data?\nThe original data downloaded has 8 Variables:\n\nProduct Code : Identifies the specific dataset or type of weather data being reported, in this case, IDCJAC0011.\nBureau of Meteorology station number :A unique identifier for the weather observation station where the data was collected, such as station number 86338.\nYear :The year the data was recorded, for example, 2023.\nMonth :The month of the year when the weather data was recorded.\nDay :The specific day of the month when the weather data was recorded.\nMaximum temperature (Degree C) or Minimum temperature (Degree C):The highest or lowest temperature recorded for the day in degrees Celsius.\nDays of accumulation of maximum temperature :The number of days over which maximum temperature data has been accumulated or aggregated.\nQuality :A measure of the reliability or accuracy of the recorded data, often indicated by a quality rating or flag.\n\n\n\nHow do we process the data?\n\nDownload all the available data for both the maximum and minimum temperature for Melbourne (Olympic Park) station, for all years beginning from 2013 to date.\nMerge the minimum temperature data with the maximum temperature dataset by Year, Month, Day and Quality.\nTidy up the data by renaming variables into a tidy format using janitor and removing NAs. Combine the “day/month/year” variable into a new variable called date in format: “%Y-%m-%d”, for filtering purposes.\nFilter data from 1-Sep-2022 until 31-Aug-2024 to get exactly 2 years worth of data.\nTransform the data into a longer format and separating type_temperature into 6 types, where these different types of temperature will the stored in variable: minimum_temperature_degree_c_2022, maximum_temperature_degree_c_2022, minimum_temperature_degree_c_2023, maximum_temperature_degree_c_2023, minimum_temperature_degree_c_2024 and maximum_temperature_degree_c_2024\nvariable is useful for the plot creation for having different lines for each year for minimum and maximum temperature.\nThe data is ready for the plot making process.\n\n\n\nCode for data cleaning\n\n```{r cleaning_data}\nweather_data &lt;- merge(weather_data_min, \n                      weather_data_max, \n                      by = c(\"Year\", \n                             \"Month\", \n                             \"Day\", \n                             \"Quality\")) |&gt; \n  rename_all(janitor::make_clean_names) |&gt;\n  select(year, \n         month, \n         day, \n         minimum_temperature_degree_c, \n         maximum_temperature_degree_c) |&gt;\n  rename(min_temp = minimum_temperature_degree_c, \n         max_temp =maximum_temperature_degree_c) |&gt;\n  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, month, day, sep = \"-\"), \n                        format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")) |&gt;\n  filter(date &gt; as.Date(\"2022-08-31\") & date &lt;= as.Date(\"2024-08-31\"))\n\nweather_long &lt;- weather_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = c(min_temp, max_temp),\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"temperature\") |&gt;\n  mutate(variable = paste(variable, \n                          year, \n                          sep = \"_\"))\n```"

The highest temperature being 40℃ in 2023. When comparing 2023 to 2022, we can see from graph 12 that 2022 had higher maximum temperatures reaching 38℃. In this case, we can see a trend that the summers had gotten cooler, especially in 2024, compared to the two previous summers (Newswire, 2023). These findings are consistent with Table 1 where we can see that the lowest median max temperature is 16℃ in 2022 and 15.2℃ in 2023, while it is 13.1℃ in 2024.\nIn terms of winter, plot 6 to 8 shows more frequent dips in temperature in 2024 compared to 2023, as temperatures reached nearly 0℃ on three different occasions. While in 2023, a dip nearing 0℃ occurred only once. As seen on Table 1, the lowest median minimum temperature is 9.45℃ in 2022, 8.85℃ in 2023 and 7.2℃ in 2024. We can see that the pattern is evident with 2024 being the coolest year with lower temperatures compared to the two previous years (Saunders, 2024; Convery & Taylor, 2024).\nFrom these observations, it is evident that 2024 had cooler temperatures compared to two previous years. Why is this?\nResearchers stated that this inconsistency in weather patterns can be attributed to two major factors Westra et al., 2014; Schmidt, 2023):\n\nClimate change\nChanging relationships between climate drivers including El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM)\n\nClimate change causes irregularities in weather patterns, including causing unsolicited rains on a perfectly sunny day or temperature drops on a warm day (Westra et al., 2014; Schmidt, 2023). This in turn, alters the interactions between climate drivers, while the El Niño was supposed to increase temperatures, the SAM brings cold air from Antarctica to Australia, which helps to cool down the heat (Keenan, 2024). As a result, temperatures have become more unpredictable, leading to increased fluctuations and less accurate weather forecasts"

    "text": "So, what now?\nIn conclusion, we found that the year 2024 is the coolest year in the past two years, with cooler winters and summers, accompanied with more dips in the temperatures during winter (King et al., 2024). Moreover, the frequency of “four seasons in a day” occurring in Melbourne in the past two years can be attributed to climate change, which leads to erratic weather patterns and affects the relationship between climate drivers. While so, with the development of AI and weather forecasting technologies, erratic weather patterns will be more accurately predicted in the future."
